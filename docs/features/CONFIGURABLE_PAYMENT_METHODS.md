# Configurable Payment Methods

**Version**: 4.20.0  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Spec**: `.kiro/specs/configurable-payment-methods/`

## Overview

The Configurable Payment Methods feature transforms the payment method system from a hardcoded enum to a database-driven configurable system. Users can now manage payment methods, track credit card balances, record payments, and upload statements.

## Features

### Payment Method Types

Four payment method types are supported:

1. **Cash** - Simple cash payments
2. **Cheque** - Cheque payments
3. **Debit** - Debit card payments
4. **Credit Card** - Full credit card tracking with:
   - Credit limit and current balance
   - Utilization percentage calculation
   - Payment due date tracking
   - Billing cycle management
   - Payment history
   - Statement uploads

### Payment Method Management

Access via the "💳 Payment Methods" button in the main navigation:

- **View all payment methods** grouped by type
- **Create new payment methods** with type-specific fields
- **Edit existing payment methods** (name, details, limits)
- **Activate/deactivate** payment methods (inactive methods hidden from dropdowns but preserved for historical data)
- **Delete** payment methods with zero associated expenses

### Credit Card Features

For credit card type payment methods:

- **Balance Tracking**: Automatic balance updates when expenses are added/deleted
- **Utilization Indicator**: Color-coded display (green < 30%, yellow 30-70%, red > 70%)
- **Payment Recording**: Log payments to reduce balance
- **Payment History**: View all recorded payments with dates and notes
- **Statement Uploads**: Attach PDF statements with period dates
- **Due Date Reminders**: Alerts when payment due within 7 days

### Credit Card Posted Date

For credit card expenses, an optional "Posted Date" field allows distinguishing between:

- **Transaction Date**: When the purchase was made
- **Posted Date**: When the charge appeared on the credit card

This affects balance calculations - expenses are counted toward the balance based on their posted date (or transaction date if no posted date is set).
