# Deprecated Documentation

This folder contains documentation for features and workflows that are no longer supported or have been replaced.

## Contents

### README_SILENT_MODE.md
Documentation for the old Windows batch scripts (`.bat`) and VBScript (`.vbs`) files that were used to start/stop the application in silent mode. These scripts have been removed in favor of:
- Docker-based deployment (recommended)
- PowerShell scripts for build/deployment automation
- Standard npm commands for development

**Archived:** February 2026
**Reason:** Windows batch scripts removed; Docker and PowerShell are now the standard approach
