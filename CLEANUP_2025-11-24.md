## Archive Structure

```
archive/
├── README.md                    # Archive documentation
├── completion-reports/          # 20 completion reports
├── test-scripts/                # 15 test scripts
├── migration-scripts/           # 6 migration scripts
└── spec-summaries/              # 4 spec summaries
```

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files documented one-time events or completed work:
- ✅ Features are now implemented and working
- ✅ Migrations have been run successfully
- ✅ Optimizations are complete
- ✅ Tests have been executed and passed
- ✅ Cleanups have been performed

The information is preserved in:
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history and feature releases
- **Git history** - Complete audit trail of all changes
- **Active specs** - Current requirements and design documents
- **Archive folder** - Historical documentation for reference

---

## Restoration

If you need to reference any archived file:

```powershell
# View archive contents
Get-ChildItem archive/ -Recurse

# Restore a specific file
Copy-Item archive/completion-reports/[filename] ./

# Restore all files from a category
Copy-Item archive/test-scripts/* backend/scripts/
```
